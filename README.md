## My Story

Life has shown me in very vivid ways how precious, fragile, resilient and beautiful life is.  When I'm at my best, I am a living the life of an always curious seeker who sees a lot of humor in life.  I just want to do whatever I can to help others.  I love quest stories and my favorite characters are the ones who become more than you'd ever imagine from unexpected beginnings.  Yes, I was born and raised in North Dakota.  When I'm at my worst, I forget this story and seek worth from things outside my control.

## My Story Principles
- Every Day Is A Gift
- Every Person Is A Wonder
- Life is Short
- If I'm not having fun or this isn't important to me, why am I doing it?
